## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please contact me at either novaw@warrenservices.co.uk, or novawittam@gmail.com. If you contact both, please make it to one and cc the other.
I'll try and keep you updated as I investigate and attempt a fix, and may ask for additional information.
Once confirmed and fixed, I will push to NPM, mark vulnerable versions as deprecated, and release a public security advisory.
